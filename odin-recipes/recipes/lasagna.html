        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to assemble your perfect lasagna:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the Meat Sauce:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and beef broth/red wine (if using). Stir in oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using).</li>
                    <li>Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it gently simmer for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1-2 hours for a richer flavor, stirring occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if not using oven-ready):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Lay them flat on parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble the Lasagna:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                    <li>Top with about one-third of the shredded mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Spoon about one-third of the remaining meat sauce over the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta, mozzarella, and meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bake the Lasagna:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you can spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking to the cheese).</li>
                    <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes for easier serving.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
